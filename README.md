<h1 align="center">Welcome to  Oh my Dog! üëã</h1>

> A funny single-page application where users can upload a picture of a dog and see a gallery of pictures of dogs of the same breed.

## What's done

- [x] The app should allow users to upload a picture and see it in a preview
- [x] The app should classify a dog present in the image based on its breed and display the result
- [x] The app should showcase pictures of dogs of the same breed in a gallery below
- [x] The gallery should take all the available screen space and consist of lazy-loaded images
- [x] The user should be able to mark a task completed
- [x] The images that don‚Äôt fit the current screen should be accessible with an ‚Äúinfinite scroll‚Äù-approach.

As a bonus :

- [x] App testing with Jest and react-testing-library allows to test the app from user side and accessibility
- [x] React context to avoid props drilling. It was decided not to overload the application with redax and other libraries
- [x] Style-components to separate business logic from render logic
- [x] App deployed to Vercel
- [x] ESlint and prettier for automatic code formatting and matching it to best practice and code style
- [x] Responsive layout
